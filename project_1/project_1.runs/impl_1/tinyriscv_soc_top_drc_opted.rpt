DPOP-3#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp output u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#2 Warning

DSP u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp__0 output u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp multiplier stage u_tinyriscv_core/u_exu/u_exu_muldiv/mul_res_tmp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PLCK-58#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	jtag_TCK_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in jtag_TCK_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to K13
	jtag_TCK_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) cannot be placed
